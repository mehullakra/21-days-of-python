# 21 Days of Python

Just for fun.

## Who This Is For

If you can generate good logic and read code well but struggle to write code fluently, this is for you. This addresses the classic "passive vs active" knowledge gap - reading code builds comprehension, but writing builds fluency.

## Structure

Progressive difficulty over 3 weeks:

- **Week 1:** Basic syntax and data structures
- **Week 2:** Functions and modules  
- **Week 3:** Classes and file handling

---

## Week 1: Basic Syntax & Data Structures

**Day 1:** Write a program that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with only even numbers doubled.

**Day 2:** Create a dictionary from two lists (keys and values) and print all key-value pairs where the value is greater than 10.

**Day 3:** Take a string and return a dictionary counting each character's frequency.

**Day 4:** Given a list of dictionaries representing students with 'name' and 'grade' keys, print names of students with grades above 85.

**Day 5:** Write a program that finds the second largest number in a list without using built-in sort functions.

**Day 6:** Create a nested dictionary representing a simple inventory (categories → items → quantities) and calculate total items across all categories.

**Day 7:** Take a list of strings and return a new list containing only strings that are palindromes (case-insensitive).

## Week 2: Functions & Modules

**Day 8:** Write a function that takes a list and returns it with duplicates removed, maintaining original order.

**Day 9:** Create a function that validates email addresses using basic rules (contains @, has domain, etc.) and test it on a list of emails.

**Day 10:** Write a recursive function to calculate factorial, then write an iterative version. Compare performance with a timer.

**Day 11:** Create a module with functions for basic math operations. Import and use it in another file to build a simple calculator.

**Day 12:** Write a function that takes nested lists of any depth and flattens them into a single list.

**Day 13:** Create a decorator that times function execution and apply it to a few different functions.

**Day 14:** Write a function that generates fibonacci sequence up to n terms, then create a generator version.

## Week 3: Classes & File Handling

**Day 15:** Create a BankAccount class with deposit, withdraw, and balance methods. Include overdraft protection.

**Day 16:** Write a program that reads a CSV file and calculates average, min, max of a numeric column.

**Day 17:** Create a Library class that manages books (add, remove, search by title/author). Save/load library state to/from JSON.

**Day 18:** Build a simple log parser that reads a text file and extracts specific patterns (IP addresses, timestamps, etc.).

**Day 19:** Create a Contact class and ContactBook class. Implement save/load functionality and search methods.

**Day 20:** Write a program that monitors a directory for new files and logs file details to a text file.

**Day 21:** Build a simple text-based game (guess the number, rock-paper-scissors, etc.) with score tracking saved to file.
