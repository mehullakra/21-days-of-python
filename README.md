# 21-days-of-python
just for fun

If you are someone who is able to generate good logic, and is also good at reading code, however cannot write code fluently.
AKA a classic "passive vs active" knowledge gap. Reading code builds comprehension, but writing builds fluency.
This repository is for you

Progressive difficulty:

Week 1: Basic syntax and data structures
Week 2: Functions and modules
Week 3: Classes and file handling

Week 1: Basic Syntax & Data Structures
Day 1: Write a program that takes a list of numbers and returns a new list with only even numbers doubled.
Day 2: Create a dictionary from two lists (keys and values) and print all key-value pairs where the value is greater than 10.
Day 3: Take a string and return a dictionary counting each character's frequency.
Day 4: Given a list of dictionaries representing students with 'name' and 'grade' keys, print names of students with grades above 85.
Day 5: Write a program that finds the second largest number in a list without using built-in sort functions.
Day 6: Create a nested dictionary representing a simple inventory (categories → items → quantities) and calculate total items across all categories.
Day 7: Take a list of strings and return a new list containing only strings that are palindromes (case-insensitive).
Week 2: Functions & Modules
Day 8: Write a function that takes a list and returns it with duplicates removed, maintaining original order.
Day 9: Create a function that validates email addresses using basic rules (contains @, has domain, etc.) and test it on a list of emails.
Day 10: Write a recursive function to calculate factorial, then write an iterative version. Compare performance with a timer.
Day 11: Create a module with functions for basic math operations. Import and use it in another file to build a simple calculator.
Day 12: Write a function that takes nested lists of any depth and flattens them into a single list.
Day 13: Create a decorator that times function execution and apply it to a few different functions.
Day 14: Write a function that generates fibonacci sequence up to n terms, then create a generator version.
Week 3: Classes & File Handling
Day 15: Create a BankAccount class with deposit, withdraw, and balance methods. Include overdraft protection.
Day 16: Write a program that reads a CSV file and calculates average, min, max of a numeric column.
Day 17: Create a Library class that manages books (add, remove, search by title/author). Save/load library state to/from JSON.
Day 18: Build a simple log parser that reads a text file and extracts specific patterns (IP addresses, timestamps, etc.).
Day 19: Create a Contact class and ContactBook class. Implement save/load functionality and search methods.
Day 20: Write a program that monitors a directory for new files and logs file details to a text file.
Day 21: Build a simple text-based game (guess the number, rock-paper-scissors, etc.) with score tracking saved to file.
